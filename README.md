# Pneumonia Detection
Utiizing CNN model to detect Pnemonia via X-Ray Image inputs. Transfer learning is utilized to obtain a better model. VGG16 and Resent_v1_50 are adopted for this dataset. Informations about the models and datasets has been attached

## Dataset
Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/code/kausthubkannan/pneumonia-detection-vgg16-model-88

## Transfer Learning Models:
VGG16 (Docs: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/vgg16/VGG16)
Resnet_V1_50 (Docs: https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/resnet_v1_50/classification/5)

## Further Improvizations:
Reducing the overfitting of the model can be done or better data cane be adopted
